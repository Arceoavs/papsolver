        | We make the world a better place by using up all prepaid accounts and remaining recharge cards. 
        | No longer are we willing to give the remaining amounts to evil companies for free!
        | Our mission is to completely disrupt the world's least noticed market. 
        | We consider an efficient use of our own resources as a fundamental right.

        | Moreover, as a secondary objective, this project serves me to become familiar with AWS.

        | The problem of obtaining a sum by the addition of discrete values of a set was modelled here as a linear program. 
        | A simple python script uses Google ORTools to implement an integer-only linear constraint solver. 
        | For the calculation of monetary values only integers are used to exclude rounding errors. 
        | This method finds an efficient, optimal solution to the problem in polynomial (linear O(n)) time 
        | and is therefore also suitable for very large optimization problems.

        | The boring ones among you can also just write to the support. 
        | In case the remaining amount is smaller than the cheapest product, you probably have no other choice.
